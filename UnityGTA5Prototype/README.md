# Unity GTA 5 Style Prototype

This is a small open-world prototype built in Unity inspired by GTA 5. It includes basic features such as:

- Third-person character controller (walking, running, jumping, melee combat)
- Basic vehicle driving system (cars, motorbikes)
- Shooting mechanics (aiming and firing)
- Simple AI enemies and police (chasing and attacking)
- Simple mission system (pickup/delivery, enemy confrontations)
- Save/load system for player data (location, health, money)

## Project Structure

- Scenes/: Unity scenes
- Scripts/: C# scripts for gameplay mechanics
- Prefabs/: Prefabricated game objects
